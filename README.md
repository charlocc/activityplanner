# American Activities Planner - Discover America

## DESCRIPTION
    This project was created as the first of a series of projects for the UCLA Coding Bootcamp. This application is meant to serve as a local tourist guide for the United States, therefore is meant to serve the needs of tourists in the US. 
    Finding information about a tourist destination can be daunting. That's why we developed a one-stop application where users can find all the relevant local information they need to plan their visit. 

    This project provided  opportunities to learn many teamwork skills, development methods, and technologies necessary to build robust applications. These include: 

        •	HTML structure, syntax, and best practices in indentation and commenting. 
        •	Bootstrap implementation: linkage, multiple properties employed, and grid arrangement.
        •	Bootstrap icon generation with <i> elements.
        •	CSS color scheme implementation, including use of global-scope color variables.
        •	CSS image linking and arrangement.
        •	Javascript best practices in indentation and commenting. 
        •	Dynamically generated HTML content with Javascript.
        •	API integration with fetch requests. 
        •	API data parsing.
        •	Terminal branch management, including creation and mergers.
        •	Github branch management.
        •	Github Kanban management. 
        •	Github pull-request management, including creation, commenting, and merging.
        •	Github issue tracking. 


## INSTALLATION

    Instructions for use are printed on the landing page (home screen) url. 
    Further, users are able to 'favorite' items by clicking on the 'add favorites' button for each item that appears in their search. The selected item(s) then appear in the 'favorites' section which is linked in the navigation bar/menu.
